Movie Recommendation System with Sentiment Analysis

A Movie Recommendation System with Sentiment Analysis is an intelligent application that suggests movies to users based not only on their viewing history, ratings, and preferences but also on the emotional tone of user-generated content such as reviews and social media posts.

This system combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering with natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By analyzing the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) in user reviews, the system gains deeper insights into what viewers truly feel about a movie, beyond just numerical ratings.

For example, even if a movie has an average rating, highly positive reviews may indicate it appeals to a specific audience segment. By incorporating sentiment analysis, the recommendation engine becomes more nuanced and personalized, offering more accurate and emotionally intelligent suggestions.
